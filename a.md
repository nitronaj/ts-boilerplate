Here is a sample README.md for a project that uses Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach and includes a diagram:
Test-Driven Development (TDD) Approach
Overview
This project follows the Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach, which emphasizes writing automated tests before writing the actual code. This approach ensures that the code is testable, reliable, and meets the required functionality.
Benefits of TDD
Improved Quality: Writing tests before code ensures that the code is testable and meets the required functionality.
Faster Development: TDD helps to identify and fix bugs early in the development cycle, reducing the overall development time.
Better Design: TDD promotes good design principles, such as loose coupling and high cohesion.
TDD Cycle
Write a Test: Write a test that covers a specific piece of functionality.
Run the Test and See it Fail: Run the test and see it fail, as the code to implement the functionality does not exist yet.
Write the Code: Write the minimal amount of code required to pass the test.
Run the Test and See it Pass: Run the test and see it pass.
Refactor the Code: Refactor the code to improve its quality and maintainability.
